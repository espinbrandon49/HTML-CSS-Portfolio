# HTML-CSS-Portfolio

## Description
This website is a collection of web applications with deployed links I developed using HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Chrome DevTools in combination so that potential employeee's can view samples of my work to assess my candidacy for an open position.

* When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.

* My portfolio uses links in  the navigation to scroll to the corresponding section.

* My portfolio includes an about me section to present my name, head shot and how to contact me.

* When you click on the link to the section about my work, you can view titled images of my web applications that are active on "clicking" to be taken to the deployed application.

* My contact section contains 4 different ways to connect with me that I can quickly respond to.
